That's patches working with Cycling 74 Max7 software.
They've been coded for the audiovisual piece by composer Fran√ßois Bousch
The patche named FB.SAMPLER.TEXTOGRAPHE.maxpat does 3 things:
- count time in order to keep control of visual sync to the music, because the musical piece is a big one : 40 minutes
- read video files then you can launch each (simple play/stop) . note that video's are not included, if need please send me an email.
- load an text file full of string and convert them to sound
For an idea about the piece  have a look at the excerpt https://youtu.be/FRnf4wUXgWU
